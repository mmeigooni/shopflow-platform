## Promoted Rules
### Guard against error contract consistency
Keep handler response contracts and error envelopes structurally consistent.
**Triggers:** retry-policy, failure-class, 4xx-decline, no-retry, retry-limit, backoff-jitter, idempotency, recursive-retry, unbounded-map, memory-pressure, lru-eviction, ttl
**Source episodes:** 7
**Rule key:** error-contract
### Guard against sensitive logging
Redact sensitive payload fields before logs leave process boundaries.
**Triggers:** redaction, payment-data, pan, pii, structured-logging, checkout, compliance, logging-sanitization, hardcoded-secret, webhook-signing-secret, secrets-in-code, env-vars
**Source episodes:** 4
**Rule key:** sensitive-logging
### Guard against input validation
Validate external input before side effects or persistence.
**Triggers:** sql-injection, parameterized-queries, prepared-statements, wildcard-escaping, like-predicate, input-sanitization, search-query, open-redirect, returnurl, allowlist, canonicalization, host-validation
**Source episodes:** 2
**Rule key:** input-validation
### Guard against review hygiene
Convert repeated review feedback into enforceable implementation checks.
**Triggers:** n+1, batch-fetch, hydrate-in-memory, keyed-map, line-items, order-listing, db-performance, cap-query-window, noisy-neighbor, wide-range-scan, pre-aggregate, high-cardinality
**Source episodes:** 2
**Rule key:** review-hygiene

## Salience Updates
- 85903f5e-3268-4083-b591-647782b30483 -> 10 (SQL injection risk plus loss of statement caching is high severity; must be top-tier.)
- 46a67ec9-38ca-4527-9aea-e97dafb3eb89 -> 10 (Open-redirects in checkout/payment flows enable phishing/token capture; elevate to critical.)
- 64857386-a05c-4795-8a67-e6b43a32c1dc -> 9 (N+1 regressions repeatedly surface in production and materially impact latency and DB load.)
- fc6549d1-520c-4ff3-8967-e8ece15d9f46 -> 6 (Debug log noise is lower risk relative to secret/token exposure; retain but de-prioritize.)
