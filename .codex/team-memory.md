## Promoted Rules
### Guard against error contract consistency
Keep handler response contracts and error envelopes structurally consistent.
**Triggers:** retry-policy, failure-class, 4xx-decline, no-retry, transient-retry, backoff-jitter, retry-limit, idempotency, recursive-retry, retry-storm, unbounded-retries, error-class-retries
**Source episodes:** 7
**Rule key:** error-contract
### Guard against sensitive logging
Redact sensitive payload fields before logs leave process boundaries.
**Triggers:** rate-limiting, tenant-scoped, token-bucket, burst-window, abuse-monitoring, coupon-validation, throttling, redaction, payment-data, pan, pii, structured-logging
**Source episodes:** 4
**Rule key:** sensitive-logging
### Guard against input validation
Validate external input before side effects or persistence.
**Triggers:** sql-injection, parameterized-queries, prepared-statements, wildcard-escaping, like-predicate, input-sanitization, search-query, open-redirect, returnurl, allowlist, canonicalization, host-validation
**Source episodes:** 2
**Rule key:** input-validation
### Guard against review hygiene
Convert repeated review feedback into enforceable implementation checks.
**Triggers:** n+1, batch-fetch, hydrate-in-memory, keyed-map, line-items, order-listing, db-performance, cap-query-window, noisy-neighbor, wide-range-scan, pre-aggregate, high-cardinality
**Source episodes:** 2
**Rule key:** review-hygiene

## Contradictions
None

## Salience Updates
- c0106efa-5a1c-4773-a206-9772c825e8fa -> 10 (Unbounded/recursive retries can trigger retry storms that saturate workers and cascade outages in payments.)
- 033deb27-6775-4a1b-80f1-e0a80b6433fd -> 10 (PII/PAN in logs is a severe PCI/compliance risk with high blast radius if leaked.)
- 656296f6-2524-4752-8bb1-8f5b0e162961 -> 10 (Hardcoded secrets enable webhook forgery and privilege escalation; top-tier security risk.)
- 8b6b540d-077a-4ef4-83aa-68800ce21868 -> 10 (Unrestricted validation endpoints invite brute-force abuse and revenue loss; limits protect availability and fraud exposure.)
- fc6549d1-520c-4ff3-8967-e8ece15d9f46 -> 5 (Once structured, level-gated logging is in place, residual console noise is lower severity compared to data/secret exposure.)
- bd39f72c-f7f7-400b-a267-0370d20e9724 -> 7 (DTO typing is valuable but narrower in impact than cross-service error-envelope standardization.)
- b2ba5141-0e9d-4741-9c84-67b90463ade0 -> 7 (Async email reduces latency but is less critical to platform safety than payments/security controls.)
